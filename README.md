# UK Fast Food Social Media Performance Analysis

# 🎯 Business Context
In today's digital world, social media is crucial for brand visibility and customer engagement. Food brands invest heavily in Instagram marketing, but often lack data-driven insights about what content resonates with their audience. This analysis provides actionable recommendations for optimising social media strategy.

# 📊 Project Overview

By examining 56 Instagram posts, this analysis reveals key insights about content strategy, posting behaviour, and customer engagement patterns.
